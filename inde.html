  <!-- DISCRIPTION ABOUT COLLEGE -->

  <div class="c">
    <p>MCM DAV College Kangra is a strong link in the chain of DAV institutions that have come to serve the cause of
      education and social upliftment not only in our country but also in many foreign countries like USA, UK, Japan,
      Mauritius, Nepal etc. After the reorganization of states, a need for an institution of higher education was felt
      in this area, as the entire Kangra district had only one Government College. In 1975 DAV College Kangra was
      established. It was later renamed as MCM DAV College in memory of the great jurist from the area -Sh Mehar Chand
      Mahajan. The College was established in an area which was then educationally and economically backward. In the
      last four decades of service the College can proudly claim to have substantially changed the education scenario.
      Our pass outs have excelled in every field – academics, bureaucracy, armed forces, sports, business, private
      sector, and even in politics and governance. An educational institution does not need any testimonials other than
      students who excel, and are productive citizens.</p>

  <div class="p">
    <p>Dear Students, I extend to you all a very warm welcome to MCM DAV College Kangra, one of the prestigious
      institutions of higher education in the state. Our endeavour is to provide high quality education to the students.
      Education literally means to provide 'training of the mind'. To provide holistic education is also one of our
      goals.
      The college emphasises the importance of critical thinking and problem­ solving skills as well as promoting love
      of
      learning and curiosity. The college tries to provide 'equitable and inclusive education' so that no student is
      denied access to quality education because of their socio- cultural background. It is also our constant effort
      that
      the students should develop global perspectives. This is my firm belief that the rich values and traditions
      imbibed
      here would carry you to the greater heights. Education is about awakening-Awakening to the power and beauty that
      lies within all of us. To my mind education is about building character, enriching minds and serving humanity.
      According to Confucius: 'Education breeds confidence. Confidence breeds hope. Hope breeds peace'. Always remember
      that when it comes to success, there are absolutely no short cuts. Ralph Waldo Emerson, the American novelist and
      essayist has well said: "I never dreamed about success, I worked for success". With proud legacy of 48 years, the
      college has excelled in every field. Many students have registered their presence in the merit lists of the
      University, others have brought laurels in cultural and sports activities. Students educated from the college have
      carved a niche for themselves in various fields at national and international levels. Our excellence is not just
      confined to the classrooms, we are also quite active in conducting conferences, workshops, seminars, talks, guest
      lectures and other co-curricular activities. These activities expose students to aspects beyond the curriculum,
      thus
      adding high value to their professional success. The magnificent infrastructure of our college sets the right
      ambience for an excellent teaching learning environment. The parents are the most strengthening power in moulding
      the future of children. Their consistent support empowers us to do more and more. I pay my gratitude to them for
      their faith in us. I, on behalf of DAV College Managing Committee, welcome all the students and wish you all the
      best for achieving greater success and scaling new heights in the coming session. With blessings and warm wishes
      Dr.
      Baljeet Singh Patial</p>
